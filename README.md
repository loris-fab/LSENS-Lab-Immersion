# LSENS-Lab-Immersion
Data management internship at the EPFL Brain Institute‚Äôs LSENS lab, working with published and unpublished neurophysiological datasets. This repository summarizes my work on converting data to the NWB format and developing small analysis pipelines from the converted datasets. Voici une version am√©lior√©e et traduite en anglais :

> For more details, you can also refer to the PDF in this repository, which is my internship report and contains valuable technical information about the different pipelines.

### 1. NWB Conversion Pipeline (Oryshchuk et al., 2024)


This repository converts behavioral and electrophysiological data from **Oryshchuk et al., 2024 (Cell Reports)** into the standardized **Neurodata Without Borders (NWB)** format.  
The study investigates how sensory, motor, and decision-related information is distributed and encoded in the mouse neocortex during goal-directed behavior.  

For detailed usage and dataset-specific notes, see the full README of this repository.

### 2. NWB Conversion Pipeline (Pierre Le Merre et al., 2018, Cell Reports)

Converts behavioral and electrophysiological data from **Pierre Le Merre et al., 2018 (Cell Reports)** into the **Neurodata Without Borders (NWB)** format.  
The study examines how distributed brain networks encode and integrate sensory, motor, and cognitive signals during goal-directed behavior in mice.

### 3. NWB Conversion Pipeline (unpublished, 2025)

Converts **single-neuron membrane potential recordings** from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of awake behaving mice into the **Neurodata Without Borders (NWB)** format.

The dataset includes two experimental conditions:

Since there is no published article yet, the dataset contains single-neuron membrane potential recordings from the medial prefrontal cortex of awake mice: Whisker rewarded (WR+) mice received water if they licked within 1 s after a whisker stimulus (go trials), but not in no-go trials; No-Task mice were head-fixed and received random whisker stimuli without a task. Recordings were obtained using whole-cell patch-clamp.
